4. Generates a detailed report showing matches

**Note:** Users' Steam profiles must be set to public to view their game library.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- A Steam Web API key

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Get a Steam Web API key:
   - Go to https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
   - Sign in with your Steam account
   - Enter any domain name (e.g., `localhost`)
   - Copy your API key

4. Create environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit `.env` file and add your Steam API key:
   ```
   STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will:
- Start on http://localhost:3000
- Automatically open in your browser
- Display a simple form for Steam ID input

## Usage

### For Users

1. Find your Steam ID:
   - Go to your Steam profile
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123456789`)
   - The number at the end is your Steam ID

2. Enter your Steam ID or full profile URL in the form

3. Click "Compare Games" to generate your report

### Privacy Requirements

- Your Steam profile must be set to **Public** for the tool to access your game library
- You can temporarily make it public, run the comparison, then set it back to private
- No personal data is stored - everything is processed in real-time

## Security

- ‚úÖ No user authentication required
- ‚úÖ No user credentials handled
- ‚úÖ Only accesses public Steam profile data
- ‚úÖ Steam API key stays on server only
- ‚úÖ No third-party authentication libraries
- ‚úÖ No data storage or logging

## API Limits

Steam Web API has rate limits:
- 100,000 requests per day per API key
- Reasonable usage should stay well within limits

## Troubleshooting

### "Steam profile is private" error
- Set your Steam profile to Public in Privacy Settings
- Make sure your "Game details" are set to Public

### "Invalid Steam ID" error
- Use the 17-digit Steam ID64 format (starts with 765611...)
- Check your profile URL for the correct ID

### "Steam API key not configured" error
- Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains `STEAM_API_KEY=your_key`
- Restart the server after adding the API key
